![PyCitySchools](education.png)

## Project Overview
As the new Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, the goal is to provide strategic insights and recommendations to the school board and mayor. This involves analyzing district-wide standardized test results, including math and reading scores, as well as various school-related information. The analysis aims to identify trends and patterns in school performance to inform future budget allocation and policy decisions.

## Project Structure
- **Repository**: [pandas-challenge](https://github.com/onemanlutta/pandas-challenge)
- **Folder Structure**:
  - **PyCitySchools**: Contains the main Jupyter Notebook file (`PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb`) for data analysis.
  - **Resources**: Contains the datasets used for analysis (`schools_complete.csv` and `students_complete.csv`).
  - **Analysis Report**: The analysis report in Word format (`PyCitySchoolsAnalysisReport.docx`).

## Data Files
- **schools_complete.csv**: Contains information about each school in the district.
- **students_complete.csv**: Includes data on each student's performance, including math and reading scores.

## Observations
1. **Spending Impact**: Schools with lower per student budgets (<$585) tend to have higher overall passing rates compared to schools with higher per student budgets.
2. **School Type Effect**: Charter schools consistently outperform district schools in terms of overall passing rates.
